# R-srqtools

## Description
These are functions that individuals write on R in order to solve specific problems in biological information-related research. 
The purpose is to complete calculations quickly and simply.

## Involving function

* **ProsigA**: In proteomics, the empirical distribution is used to calculate the P value for the data without duplicates (used to assess whether the two biological duplicate data are qualified duplicates).

* **SimpleWGCNA**: Use the established parameters, simplify the WGCNA code, and facilitate repeated calculations.

* **corMatrix**: Calculate the correlation coefficient between two Matrices (different from the correlation coefficient matrix).
